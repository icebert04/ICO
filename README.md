# ICO (from [learnweb3.io](https://www.learnweb3.io/tracks/sophomore))

## Things that I've learned..

* Created a max of **10,000 CD(CryptoDev)** tokens
* Used **Hardhat** for smart contract deployment, as well as importing **Openzeppelin's Ownable Contract**
* Got API keys from [Alchemy](https://dashboard.alchemyapi.io/) and [Rinkeby Faucet](https://rinkebyfaucet.com/)
* npm install **Web3Modal library** in order to connect dApp to the **Metamask** wallet
* Import **Token_Contract_ABI** and **Token_Contract_Address**
* Tested minting CD tokens on Metamask on a **Next.js** static page

Here's a screenshot of the basic **ICO** minting site that I've built..
